# QRL_Entanglement

Project on Quantum Reinforcement Learning.


The goal is to show that quantum entanglement leads to improved parameter efficiency (i.e., decrease in model complexity) with comparable model performance in a QRL model.


The QRL model is based on variational quantum circuits (a.k.a. parametrized quantum circuits) and multiple QRL models were developed by combining VQC with classical Deep RL algorithms, including double DQN, Quantile Regression DQN, and Rainbow DQN.
